## A cheeky script for cropping images out of images using OpenCV and a pretrained face detector
## Written by Rebecca Campbell-Redl for DSDN487 at Victoria University of Wellington 2020

### facefinder.py finds and crops out faces 
### defaultFaceFinder.py just draws rectangles around faces
### sizer.py lets you quickly delete any images below a specified dimension
